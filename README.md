## About Me
#### I just turned 51, *can you belive it?*,  and happy to keep **learning**. I coded many years ago but I stopped when entering into the Infrastructures world. Now I like toy say that  I'm happy to code again.

>Juan: "I'm happy to code again"

#### I'm interested in **American literature** in the XX Century and travelling
