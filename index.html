<h1>My name is Juan Martinez-Sagarra Gonzalez</h1>
<p>Hi, Hey, I’m Juan Martinez-Sagarra. I’ve been working in IT for quite a while, mostly focusing on business relationships and project management. Over the last 10 years, I’ve been lucky enough to lead some digital transformation projects, work with teams from different cultures, and make sure things stay compliant in the pharma world. I’ve picked up a lot of experience with cloud stuff, IT infrastructure, and GxP compliance along the way. I really enjoy using tech to solve tough problems and I do well in fast-moving environments. From a family perspective I'm 51 years old, married, a pather of three and living in the US since 2018.</p>
